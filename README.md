### Installing and running Windows Terminal

> ðŸ”´ Note: Windows Terminal requires Windows 10 1903 (build 18362) or later

This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds
with automatic upgrades.

This is our preferred method.

##### Via GitHub

builds can be manually downloaded from [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) repository's [Releases
page](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases).
